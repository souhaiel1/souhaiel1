- :school: I am currently a Deepl Learning learning Research engineer at Parrot Drones working at the intersection of (explainable) deep learning, Computer Vision and Domain Adaptation / Generalization.  Prior to that, I was a research intern at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/fr) within the [Astra-Vision group](https://astra-vision.github.io/) working jointly with researchers from [Valeo.ai](https://www.valeo.com/en/valeo-ai/). I was also a former intern at [INRIA's Chroma team](https://team.inria.fr/chroma/en/), where I conducted research in (multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning.
- :books:  I have an Msc. degree in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (MVA) from [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr//), [Paris Saclay university](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/).  I also have an MSc. degree from [Grenoble INP](https://www.grenoble-inp.fr/) in Mobile, Autonomous Robotic Systems. Prior to that, I earned an  Engineering Degree in Robotics and Embedded Systems from [The university of Carthage](http://www.ucar.rnu.tn/), Tunisia, in 2021.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am passionate about research and I enjoy Reverse-Engineering as much as I enjoy engineering.
